<h1>Cloudflare WAF Complete Bypass</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Just to clarify the objective of this paper, Cloudflare stated to me this does "not appear to be any security implications as a direct result of this behavior". This paper is to help Cloudflare WAF clients understand the criticality of NEVER disclosing the Origin IP address in any way, through stacktrace, DNS history, DNS enumeration, subdomain enumeration, or even social engineering.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Origin IP address</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>The attacker can completely bypass: Cloudflare WAF, managed rules, IP access rules, page rules, cache. All this without being logged on the target WAF in any way. The attacker is also able to execute HTTP DOS, ignore WAF restrictions, and test/exploit vulnerabilities that would otherwise be blocked by managed rules.</p>

<h2>Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Follow this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50865917/use-htaccess-to-only-allow-requests-if-a-header-with-a-specific-value-is-presen">instruction</a> and set it on Cloudflare -> Transform Rules -> HTTP Request Header Modification</li>
    <li>Rotate your IP address and ensure it never leaks</li>
    <li>Use a custom authenticated Origin pull certificate (Enterprise only, not tested)</li>
    <li>Use a Cloudflare tunnel and NEVER leak the CNAME</li>
    <li>Filter by hostname in the backend (Bypassable, but requires enterprise-level Hostname Override)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>Initial State</h3>
<p>First, let's enumerate all the enabled or not security layers on the attacked application:</p>
<p>UFW with default incoming block has these exceptions:</p>
<img src="images/01UFW.png" alt="UFW Settings">
<p>Authenticated origin pull not configured, Cloudflare edge certificate being used:</p>
<img src="images/02initial_apache_conf.png" alt="Apache Config">
<p>Only one Cloudflare DNS entry, proxying traffic to the attacked application. (Also note this account email is "@hotmail.com")</p>
<img src="images/03pix2pix_dns.png" alt="DNS Entry">
<p>SSL/TLS on Full (strict) since it's using an Edge certificate</p>
<img src="images/04pix2pix_ssl.png" alt="SSL Setting">
<p>Initially deactivated Authenticated Origin Pulls</p>
<img src="images/05pix2pix_initial_pull.png" alt="Origin Pulls">
<p>No enabled WAF rules</p>
<img src="images/06pix2pix_initial_waf.png" alt="WAF Rules">
<p>And here is the webpage:</p>
<img src="images/07pix2pix_page.png" alt="Web Page">

<h3>Setting Up WAF</h3>
<p>Let's set up a WAF rule to bypass as an example:</p>
<p>The rule:</p>
<img src="images/08pix2pix_waf_rule.png" alt="WAF Rule">
<p>Turning it on:</p>
<img src="images/09pix2pix_blocking.png" alt="Activating Rule">
<p>Testing the rule:</p>
<img src="images/10pix2pix_blocked.png" alt="Rule Test">

<h3>Bypassing UFW</h3>
<p>On this step, I will show how to bypass the Firewall IPTables rules (UFW).</p>
<p>As stated before, as a requirement for this bypass you need to know/discover the Origin IP for the target in one of the many possible ways. This screenshot shows a DNS entry on another domain, another account (@gmail.com) to the same Origin IP:</p>
<img src="images/11cart_dns.png" alt="DNS Entry Other Domain">
<p>SSL/TLS needs to be set up to "Full" since the Edge certificate is from another account:</p>
<img src="images/12cart_ssl.png" alt="SSL for Other Domain">
<p>For now, the Authenticated Origin Pull will be off:</p>
<img src="images/13cart_pull.png" alt="Origin Pull Off">
<p>No WAF rules:</p>
<img src="images/14cart_waf.png" alt="No WAF Rules">
<p>No HTTP DOS protection:</p>
<img src="images/15_cart_dos.png" alt="No DOS Protection">
<p>Since we will be talking to the IP through Cloudflare, the IP IS IN THE UFW LIST already. Since this attacked account has no security layers from Cloudflare enabled, we are able to bypass the "block all" Cloudflare WAF rule as well as any of the already stated Cloudflare features (Cloudflare WAF, managed rules, IP access rules, page rules, cache). We won't be logged in the WAF because the logs will be on the attacker's own account.</p>

<h3>Bypassing Authenticated Origin Pulls</h3>
<p>One of the security layers recommended by Cloudflare to protect the Origin server are the "Authenticated Origin pulls", so let's activate it.</p>
<p>Setting up Apache:</p>
<img src="images/17pix2pix_enabling_auth.png" alt="Apache Auth Setup">
<p>Enabling on Cloudflare:</p>
<img src="images/18pix2pix_enabling_auth_2.png" alt="Cloudflare Auth On">
<p>Temporarily disabling the WAF rule for testing:</p>
<img src="images/19pix2pix_disable_waf.png" alt="WAF Off">
<p>WebPage successfully loaded:</p>
<img src="images/20pix2pix_page.png" alt="Page Load Success">
<p>Enabling the rule:</p>
<img src="images/21pix2pix_blocking.png" alt="Rule On">
<p>Being blocked by the rule:</p>
<img src="images/22pix2pix_blocked.png" alt="Rule Block">
<p>Lets open the attacker URL again and see what happens:</p>
<img src="images/23cart_without_pull.png" alt="Attack URL No Auth">
<p>The problem is that non-enterprise accounts, and even probably most enterprise accounts that use authenticated origin pull, use Cloudflare's recommended certificate. So, enabling Authenticated Pull on the attacker account is also:</p>
<img src="images/24cart_pull_enabled.png" alt="Attacker Auth Pull">
<p>Accessing the attacker website bypassing both authenticated origin pull and the WAF rule:</p>
<img src="images/25cart_bypass.png" alt="Complete Bypass">
<p>Since the certificate is the same for almost all Authenticated Origin Pull, enabling Authenticated origin pull on the attacker account is enough.</p>
<p>If you use Cloudflare WAF and can't periodically rotate IP or you're unsure if the IP will leak by the application or subdomains, use a custom authenticated pull certificate or use a Cloudflare tunnel. Otherwise, you risk an attacker being able to completely ignore any security layers on a Cloudflare application, from WAF vulnerability mitigations to HTTP DOS.</p>

<h1>Protect and hide your Origin Server IP at all costs, and rotate periodically, or someone might map the entire IPv4 space and find you.</h1>
